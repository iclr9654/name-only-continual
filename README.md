# RAINBOW GENERATOR: A GENERATIVE APPROACH FOR NAME ONLY CONTINUAL LEARNING

We provide the dataset used for iclr 9654 submission, generated using Stable Diffusion XL, DALL.E-2, DeepFloyd IF, CogView2, Stable Diffusion 3, and AuraFlow.

Disclaimer
This dataset is created solely for academic purposes. We minimized human intervention to ensure a fair comparison with the baseline methods discussed in our paper. Despite our efforts, the extensive size of the dataset prevented us from examining each image individually.

Therefore, we emphasize that this dataset should only be used for academic purposes, and we disclaim any issues arising from improper use. Specifically, this dataset is recommended solely for assessing the performance of classification models derived from datasets generated by generative models.
